1. Definition of cell type:
	1. Original: tissue function + cell morphology.
	2. Extended with presence/absence fo cell surface markers and gene expression.
2. Why?
	1. Samples are heterogeneous. 
	2. Especially for tumor samples.
	3. Enables data interpretation, also find new cell types.
3. Cell types differ based off of cell surface markers.
	1. mRNA of these are low expressed or even absent. 
4. Automate: use a complete cell type mRNA expression to compare each cell's mRNA expression. 
5. Done through: ad hoc methods, machine learning methods, per individual cell, or per cluster of cells. 
6. Databases:

8. Expression of tumor cells: similar to fibroflasts.
	1. Use copy-number variations.

11. Single R: rich reference data. 
	1. Has bunch of reference datasets. ![[Screenshot 2024-08-05 at 1.48.03 PM.png]]
12. Why does the thing in the middle win?
