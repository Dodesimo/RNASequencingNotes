1. Multiplexed FISH data:
	1. How to determine cell types?
	2. Cell segmentation.
	3. Counting mRNAs within each cell's border.
	4. Clustering cells.
	5. Identifying cell types. 
2. Requirements for SSAM![[Screenshot 2024-08-05 at 6.36.47 PM.png]]
3. Uses kernels (symmetric functions) to calculate density for gene expression. 
4. Stack in order to generate a vector field. 
5. Then, cluster each pixel to find clusters corresponding to certain tissues.
	1. **How do you get the labels?**
